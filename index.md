# About Me

<img src="https://zhanglitga.github.io/zhangli.JPG" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

**Li Zhang**, male, born in 1991, holds a Ph.D. degree and currently serves as a senior engineer at the [Institute of Geophysical and Geochemical Exploration of the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences(IGGE, CAGS)](http://www.igge.cgs.gov.cn/).
He specializes in researching the macro-distribution patterns, enrichment mechanisms, and biogeochemical cycling of soil elements. Utilizing national land geochemical survey data and employing various data analysis methods, he has explored the state of soil quality, element distribution, driving factors of soil elements, as well as the ecological and health risks associated with heavy metals in typical high geological background areas of Southwest China. Li Zhang's contributions serve the fields of land resource management, soil pollution prevention and control.

## Research Interests

- **CURRENT RESEARCH INTERESTS** \
**Environmental Geochemistry**: in particular, focuses on \
(1) soil environmental geochemical mapping and geochemical baseline; \
(2) the geochemical characterization of environmental matrices, contaminated and not, as soil and sediment at a regional and local scale, to evaluate natural and anthropogenic pollution; \
(3) minor nutrient elements and toxic elements biogeochemical cycling in rock-soil-crop-human systems and their risk evaluation. \
**Exploratory data analysis**: in particular, focuses on\
compositional data analysis and multivariate analyses to examine the soil and sediment geochemistry data for a range of key elements (e.g., heavy metals/metalloids, Se, REEs and C). 
- **FORMER RESEARCH INTERESTS** \
**Petrology and Mineralogy**: in particular, focuses on ophiolites in orogenic belts, to study their petrological and mineralogical characteristics, partial melting characteristics, and tectonic backgrounds by electron microscope, electron probe micro-analysis, and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.
