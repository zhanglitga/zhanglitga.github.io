# About Me

<img src="https://zhanglitga.github.io/zhangli.JPG" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

**Li Zhang**, male, born in 1991, holds a Ph.D. degree and is a senior engineer at the [Institute of Geophysical and Geochemical Exploration of the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences(IGGE, CAGS)](http://www.igge.cgs.gov.cn/).
He is specializes in researching the macro-distribution patterns, enrichment mechanisms and biogeochemical cycling of soil elements.
He used national land geochemical survey data and various data analysis methods explored the state of soil quality, element distribution, driving factors of soil elements and the ecological risks and health risks of heavy metal in a typical high geological background areas of Southwest China to serve land resource management, soil pollution prevention and control, and protection and utilization of cultivated land.
Li Zhang has a wealth of scientific research achievements. He has undertaken 5 research projects; published 15 peer-reviewed papers, obtained 3 utility model patents, and published 1 geochemical atlas.

## Research Interests

- **CURRENT RESEARCH INTERESTS** \
**Environmental Geochemistry**: in particular, focuses on \
(1) soil environmental geochemical mapping and geochemical baseline; \
(2) the geochemical characterization of environmental matrices, contaminated and not, as soil and sediment at a regional and local scale, to evaluate natural and anthropogenic pollution; \
(3) minor nutrient elements and toxic elements biogeochemical cycling in rock-soil-crop-human systems and their risk evaluation. \
**Exploratory data analysis**: in particular, focuses on\
compositional data analysis and multivariate analyses to examine the soil and sediment geochemistry data for a range of key elements (e.g., heavy metals/metalloids, Se, REEs and C). 
- **FORMER RESEARCH INTERESTS** \
**Petrology and Mineralogy**: in particular, focuses on ophiolites in orogenic belts, to study their petrological and mineralogical characteristics, partial melting characteristics, and tectonic environment by electron microscope, electron probe micro-analysis, and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.
